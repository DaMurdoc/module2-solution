                <p>What makes Argentine beef so special? Argentine beef is a 'trademark' in itself; recognised worldwide for its tenderness and characteristic flavour. This is due to the breeding of the best breeds (Angus and Hereford) in the vast region of the Pampas; a geographical region with optimal climatic conditions and vast grassy fields where the cattle find the ideal habitat to grow. At the same time, the welfare of the animals and careful handling of the cattle are a core value in Argentina's 150-year-long cattle breeding tradition. This is very important in order to obtain a quality product. The result: a first-class beef that makes an overwhelming impression on the most demanding meat lovers.</p>

                <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.</p>
